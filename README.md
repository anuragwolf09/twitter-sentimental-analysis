NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING PROJECT.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Given Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets, your task is to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.

ALGORITHMS AND TOOLS USED:

1.NUMPY
2.PANDAS
3.NATURAL LANGUAGE TOOLKIT (NLTK)
4.COUNT VECTORIZER
5.SKLEARN
6.SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
7.MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES
8.RANDOM FOREST

APPROACH:

1.LOAD THE DATA 
2.SETTING UP TRAINING AND TESTING DATA.
3.GETTING THE DATA INTO NLTK SUITABLE FORMAT.
4.DOING DATA CLEANING USING NLTK TOOLS : STOPWORDS , POS TAG , WORDNETLEMMATIZER.
5.AFTER GETTING THE DATA CLEANING , NOW INSTEAD OF USING NLTK INBUILT CLASSIFIER WE CAN SHIFT TO SKLEARN CLASSIFIER BY CONVERTING THE DATA INTO SKLEARN SUITABLE DATA FORM.
THEREFORE USING COUNT VECTORIZER TO GET THE DATA INTO M X N MATRIX FORM.
6.APPLYING DIFFERENT SKLEARN CLASSIFIER:
 
 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
 MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES
 RANDOM FOREST

RESULT:

THE PREDICTIONS WERE TESTED ON CODING NINJAS WEBSITE AND THE ACCURACY WERE:

1.MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES: 0.7661

2.SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE : 0.6358

3.RANDOM FOREST : 0.7661

CONCLUSION:

THEREFORE MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES AND RANDOM FOREST GAVE BETTER ACCURACY. 
FURHTER WE CAN USE NUERAL NETWORKS TO GET BETTER ACCURACY.
